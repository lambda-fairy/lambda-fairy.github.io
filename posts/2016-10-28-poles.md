Our planet has many different poles. Here are a few of them:

The two **geographic poles** are the points where the Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface. The terms "North Pole" or "South Pole" refer to these poles.

While the geographic poles are defined in terms of rotation, the **magnetic** and **geomagnetic** poles are defined by the Earth's magnetic field. At the magnetic poles, the planet's magnetic field points straight down. Unlike the geographic poles, the magnetic poles are not *antipodal*, or directly opposite to each other. The geomagnetic poles, then, are an approximation of the magnetic poles which are antipodal.

Finally, we have the **ethnic Poles**. These can be found all over the planet, but are for the most part concentrated in Central Europe.

Discuss.
