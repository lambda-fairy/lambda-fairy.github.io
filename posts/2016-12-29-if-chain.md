title: Announcing if_chain

Today I published [`if_chain`][if\_chain], a macro for writing nested `if let` expressions. The [documentation] does a good job of showing how to use the crate, and I recommend taking a look through it. This article will instead go more into the background behind this macro and how it helped with my own projects.

# The problem

As part of [another project], I was working on a [lint plugin] that catches common mistakes and suggests ways to fix them. Unfortunately, the code I wrote would often look like this:

```rust
if let ExprCall(ref path_expr, ref args) = expr.node {
    if let Some(first_arg) = args.first() {
        if let ExprLit(ref lit) = first_arg.node {
            if let LitKind::Str(s, _) = lit.node {
                if s.as_str().eq_ignore_ascii_case("<!doctype html>") {
                    // ...
```

As you can see, a common issue was *rightward drift*. Every `if` statement would indent the code by one more step, such that the actual message ended up off the page!

Now, Rust does provide tools for tackling this issue; and in most cases it would be enough to use them. But for my use case---writing lints---they are not enough:

* We can rewrite each check to yield an `Option`, and use `.and_then()` or the `?` operator to chain them. But when writing a lint, the interfaces involved are so broad and irregular that wrapping everything is not practical.

* We can try to merge all these checks into a single pattern. But in this case, the intermediate nodes are wrapped in smart pointers (the [`P`][P] type), and current Rust doesn't have a way to dereference a smart pointer from within a pattern.

# Existing solutions

I wasn't the first to run into this problem. [rust-clippy], a collection of general-purpose lints, has a utility macro called [`if_let_chain!`][if\_let\_chain] for this purpose. Using this macro, the example above would be written like this instead:

```rust
if_let_chain! {[
    let ExprCall(ref path_expr, ref args) = expr.node,
    let Some(first_arg) = args.first(),
    let ExprLit(ref lit) = first_arg.node,
    let LitKind::Str(s, _) = lit.node,
    s.as_str().eq_ignore_ascii_case("<!doctype html>"),
    // ...
], {
    // ...
}}
```

This solved the rightward drift problem at hand. But as I used the macro, I found a few flaws in the implementation:

* Since `if_let_chain!` is a part of Clippy, I would have to either copy-and-paste the macro, or depend on the whole of Clippy. It would be better if the macro was in its own crate.

* When inspecting the type of an expression, for example, the code involved can be quite long. One would use intermediate variables (`let` statements) to keep the code easy to read. But since `if_let_chain!` expects every line to be an `if` or `if let`, there's no good way of doing this refactoring.

* Some of the syntax choices, like omitting the `if` from each check and the use of square brackets, seem arbitrary to me. I'd prefer it if the macro looks more like the generated code.

# Introducing `if_chain`

Here's where `if_chain` comes in. It addresses the points raised above, and adds some features of its own:

* *Fallback values*. `if_chain!` lets you give an `else` clause, which is evaluated when any of the checks fail to match.

* *Multiple patterns*. Rust allows for matching multiple patterns at once in a `match` expression. For example, this code:

    ```rust
    let x = 1;
    match x {
        1 | 2 => println!("one or two"),
        _ => println!("something else"),
    }
    ```

    prints "one or two." `if_chain!` supports this syntax in `if let` as well.

Our example now [looks like this][live code]:

```rust
if_chain! {
    if let ExprCall(ref path_expr, ref args) = expr.node;
    if let Some(first_arg) = args.first();
    if let ExprLit(ref lit) = first_arg.node;
    if let LitKind::Str(s, _) = lit.node;
    if s.as_str().eq_ignore_ascii_case("<!doctype html>");
    // ...
    then {
        // ...
    }
}
```
