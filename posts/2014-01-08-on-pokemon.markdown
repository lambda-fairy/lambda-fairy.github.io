title: On Pokémon: the color of science

Yesterday I hatched an Eevee.  It was *shiny*, which in Poké-parlance means it had a rare mutation that changed its color.  In this case, its fur was snow-white instead of brown.

(I named him Edam, after the cheese.  I like cheese.)

Ponder that for a moment.  What's another name for a rare mutation that bleaches a creature white?

[Albinism][]!

For a generic quasi-mammalian fur-ball such as Eevee, it makes sense that some of them are albino—a trait found in all mammals.  The creators of Pokémon have really done their homework here, grounding something as obscure as an alternate palette in the biology of the real world.
