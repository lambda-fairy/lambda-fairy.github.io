title: Shooting yourself in the foot
---

I've come up with a few ["shooting yourself in the foot"][m5p] jokes over the years. I hope you can get a decent chuckle out of these â˜º

Go
--

You shoot many feet, all at the same time, very, very, quickly.


Python
------

You take out your gun, aim it at your foot, and pull the trigger. It creates a perfectly round hole in the middle of its target.

You pat yourself on the back and limp out of the office, proud of a job well done.


Eiffel
------

You can't.


OCaml
-----

You create a new foot that is already shot, and treat that as the original.  Your old foot gradually fades away.


Haskell
-------

You try to shoot yourself in the foot, but can't figure out how. So you post your problem on StackOverflow.

A few minutes later, you receive five replies: all of them different, none of which you understand, and at least one of which uses a library [Edward Kmett][] wrote last week.

I was just thinking... you know about gun accidents?

<i>Yeah, what about them&mdash;</i>

So many people get hurt &mdash;killed, even&mdash; by guns, every single day. And you know how they get hurt? Because SOMEONE ELSE IS POINTING THE GUN AT THEM.

<i>Obviously&mdash;</i>

Don't interrupt, Rasmus. You're breaking my flow.

<i>Sorry.</i>

Anyway, I was thinking -- why not fix the problem right at the beginning? Why don't we plug the hole *right at its source*?

<i>You mean, like improved education, tougher licensing laws&mdash;</i>

No, Rasmus, don't you see? Accidents happen only when people point their gun *away* from themselves.

<i>You've lost me now. Go on.</i>

Rasmus, I want every gun made from now on changed... *to [fire backwards][lolphp].*

You aim the gun at your foot, and pull the trigger. Your head explodes.
