title: Shooting yourself in the foot
description: A few original variations on the theme.
---

I've come up with a few ["shooting yourself in the foot"][m5p] jokes over the years. I hope you can get a decent chuckle out of these â˜º

[m5p]: http://m5p.com/~pravn/foot.html


Python
------

You take out your gun, aim it at your foot, and pull the trigger. It creates a perfectly round hole in the middle of its target.

You pat yourself on the back and limp out of the office, proud of a job well done.


Go
--

You shoot many feet, all at the same time, very, very, quickly.


Haskell
-------

You try to shoot yourself in the foot, but can't figure out why. So you post your problem on StackOverflow.

A few minutes later, you receive five replies: all of them different, none of which you understand, and at least one of which uses a library Edward Kmett wrote last week.

What's a foot?
