As of today, all requests to `lambda.xyz` will be served over HTTPS via [CloudFlare][].

Though my host (GitHub Pages) has supported HTTPS for a while now, their certificate only works on sites hosted under `github.io`. Since I use a custom domain, my website missed out on this feature...

... until now! Recently CloudFlare announced [free SSL for everybody][Universal SSL], no matter how their site was hosted. So I signed up with them---only took a few minutes or so---and here we are.

In other news, I installed [Cloud to Butt Plus][butts] a few days ago. It's making all this quite fun to read.
