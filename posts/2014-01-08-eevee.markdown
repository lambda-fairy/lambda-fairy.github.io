Yesterday I hatched an Eevee.  It was *shiny*, which in Pok√©-parlance means it had a rare mutation that changed its color.  In this case, its fur was snow-white instead of brown.

(I named him Edam, after the cheese.  I like cheese.)

Wait a second---what's the name of a rare mutation that bleaches a creature white?

[Albinism][]!

For a quasi-mammalian fur-ball such as Eevee, it makes sense that some of them are albino---a trait found in all mammals.  Game Freak have really done their homework here, haven't they?
