A few days ago, my proposal, ["Flesh out features of Hackage 2.0"][proposal], was accepted into this year's [Google Summer of Code][GSoC] -- hooray!

In case you're wondering: *Hackage* is a repository of software for the *Haskell* programming language. My project aims to improve parts of the Hackage interface, to make various features easier to use.

I'll post updates semi-regularly to [this very blog][blog], so stay tuned!
