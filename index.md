# What is a lambda fairy?

A *lambda fairy* is a creature of software development folklore.
It wanders the streets of Silicon Valley,
hoping to catch a poor engineer facing a deadline they can't make.

The fae will present an offer:
the work will be done by morning---for a price.

Chris is not a lambda fairy.
