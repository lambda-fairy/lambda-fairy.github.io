This is the personal website of Chris Wong,
a person who likes to create things.

# Software

I build and maintain software for a living.
My strengths are in attention to detail;
a precise, systematic approach;
and communication (both spoken and written).

More details are on [my CV].

# Writing

I like to write for the [SCP Foundation],
a collaborative fiction site about a paranormal research organization
of the same name.

My two stories,
[Coordinated Universal Time] and [Irrational Exuberance],
talk about technology and its role in society.

# Music

I also like to compose music, mostly in a modern classical style.
My influences include Béla Bartók and Charles Ives,
avant-garde composers who straddled the line between transcendent and grotesque.

I have one piece I'm proud of:
[Party cannon], a little piece about an equally little pony.
I hope to have more some day.

# What is a lambda fairy?

A *lambda fairy* is a creature of software development folklore.
It wanders the streets of Silicon Valley,
hoping to catch a poor engineer facing a deadline they can't make.

The fae will present an offer:
the work will be done by morning---for a price.

Chris is not a lambda fairy.
