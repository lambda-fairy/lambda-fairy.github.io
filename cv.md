# Projects

Most of this work can also be found on [GitHub].

[GitHub]: https://github.com/lambda-fairy

[Maud](https://maud.lambda.xyz)
  : HTML template engine implemented as a Rust procedural macro. Templates are written inline using Rust syntax, and type-checked and optimized with the rest of the program.

[if\_chain](https://lambda.xyz/blog/if-chain/)
  : An implementation of pattern guards for Rust. Used by the Clippy lint tool.

[juxta](https://github.com/lambda-fairy/juxta)
  : Library for writing comparison functions in TypeScript, inspired by contravariant functors.

[Guess the Number](https://lambda.xyz/gtn/)
  : A subversive number guessing game. Uses a bisecting algorithm to make the game impossible to win. Written in HTML and JavaScript/ES6.
