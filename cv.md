Experience
==========

## Google

Software engineering intern, 2015--2016

* Developed tools for profiling the style engine in Chrome (Blink).


## University of Canterbury

Python developer, 2014--2015

* Extended the online quiz system for the 200-level course "Formal Languages and Compilers".
* Implemented a pushdown automaton simulator, with documentation and tests.
* Used by 145 students in 2015.


## Google Summer of Code

Student, 2014

* Worked on [Hackage], the repository of software for the Haskell programming language.
* Added *build reports* to the interface, which indicated whether a package could be built on the server.

Projects
========

Most of this work can also be found on [GitHub].

[GitHub]: https://github.com/lfairy

[Maud](http://lfairy.gitbooks.io/maud/content/)
  : An HTML template engine implemented as a Rust compiler plugin. Templates are written inline using Rust syntax, and type-checked and optimized with the rest of the program.

[Gensokyo](https://github.com/lfairy/gensokyo)
  : Toy operating system built upon Rust and UEFI.

[Arroyo](https://github.com/lfairy/arroyo)
  : Server that handles GitHub web hooks. Features authentication (via HMAC signatures) and simple configuration via shell scripts. Written in Python.

[Guess the Number](https://lambda.xyz/gtn/)
  : A subversive number guessing game. Uses a bisecting algorithm to make the game impossible to win. Written in HTML and JavaScript/ES6.
