# Projects

Most of this work can also be found on [GitHub].

[GitHub]: https://github.com/lfairy

[Maud](https://maud.lambda.xyz)
  : An HTML template engine implemented as a Rust procedural macro. Templates are written inline using Rust syntax, and type-checked and optimized with the rest of the program.

[Arroyo](https://github.com/lfairy/arroyo)
  : Server that handles GitHub web hooks. Features authentication (via HMAC signatures) and simple configuration via shell scripts. Written in Python.

[Karkinos](https://github.com/lfairy/karkinos)
  : Online directory of people interested in the Rust programming language. Features a bespoke full-text search engine and a mobile-first design.

[Guess the Number](https://lambda.xyz/gtn/)
  : A subversive number guessing game. Uses a bisecting algorithm to make the game impossible to win. Written in HTML and JavaScript/ES6.
