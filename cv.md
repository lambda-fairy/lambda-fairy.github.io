Projects & Contributions
========================

Most of this work can also be found on [GitHub][].

[Hackage](https://github.com/haskell/hackage-server/wiki/GSoC-2014) (2014)
  : The central repository for Haskell software. I worked on this project as part of the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/).

[Rose](https://github.com/lfairy/rose) (2013--2014)
  : Regular expression engine for Rust. By incorporating ideas from automata theory, I avoid the exponential blowup that plagues other engines.

[Sparkle](/sparkle) (2013)
  : A project planning tool, structured around the New Zealand secondary curriculum. Although technologically simple, vague requirements and tight deadlines made the project difficult to pull off.

[honk](/honk) (2012--2013)
  : PC speaker interface for Haskell. This toy project gave me a taste of low-level programming, working with the Linux ioctl interface directly.

[http-conduit](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-conduit)
  : HTTP client library. I removed the existing ad-hoc URL parser, replacing it with a call to an existing library. The result was shorter and easier to read.

[pycode](https://github.com/trampgeek/pycode) (2012)
  : An automatic marking system, used for grading CS assignments at the University of Canterbury. I [fixed a few bugs](https://github.com/trampgeek/pycode/pull/3) in the handling of files.
