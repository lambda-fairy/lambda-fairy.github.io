# DT Cannon tips!

In modern Tetris, the [DT Cannon] opener is a popular way to start the game.
It's great for beginners because:

- It introduces **T-spin triples** and **counter-clockwise rotation** -- two concepts that a beginner might otherwise not be exposed to.

- It **guarantees 11 attack**.
  For beginners, usually the biggest problem is in building enough attack power to knock the opponent out.
  DT Cannon gives them a head start.

- Unlike more powerful openers, it's **not an instant KO**.
  So you still have an opportunity to develop fundamental stacking skills, and not fall on the opener as a crutch.

That said, many resources out there only focus on building the basic shape, and don't discuss how to apply it in a real game.
I hope to fill in this gap so you can DT Cannon like a pro ðŸ™‚

## Stack it on the left

Most openers have a mirror image that works in a similar way.
DT Cannon is no exception -- you could build the Cannon on the right-hand side, if you wanted to.

However, it's always a better idea to build DT Cannon on the left.
This is because you can hard drop the first three pieces from their starting positions, without having to move or rotate them:

These saved key presses are what make DT Cannon so fast to build, and you'll lose this benefit if you mirror it.

## Don't waste your T pieces

You'll need to use your first T piece to stack the DT Cannon.
This is unavoidable -- while there is a build that avoids this, it's rare and not worth learning.

But there's no need to waste the second or third T pieces as well.
You should aim to spin both these pieces into the cannon, and *not* use them to stack up.
This is important because:

- It will make the **stack too high**.
  DT Cannon is risky to build, as you have to stack quite high before sending the attack.
  If you waste your T pieces -- your only way down -- you'll force yourself to stack even higher, and increase the risk of your opponent knocking you out first.

- It will make it **hard to stack**.
  T pieces tend to make the stack bumpy.[^parity]
  This is fine when stacking normally, as you have 9 columns of space to work with, but the DT Cannon doesn't have that much room.
  Moreover, to fix that bumpiness, you'll often have to waste another T piece as well -- further delaying your attack.

[^parity]: The technical term is *[checkerboard parity]*.

## Send both T-spins at once (if you can)

If you can, consider holding your T piece and sending both the Double and Triple in one go.

By sending the two attacks consecutively, you increase your 11 attack to 12.

But don't insist too hard on this combo.
If T-spinning early will let you build a flatter stack, then go ahead and do that instead.
Keeping a clean board is much more important than the 1 extra attack.

## Watch out for early spikes

DT Cannon isn't the only opener out there.
The [Perfect Clear Opener (PCO)][pco] is common at beginner ranks as well, and if your opponent hits that 61% success rate, they'll knock you out before you can send anything back.

In general, if you know that your opponent has access to a big early attack (PCO or otherwise), avoid DT Cannon.[^wellactually]

[^wellactually]:
    Technically, if you build the DT Cannon fast enough, you can cancel out the PCO and survive.
    And if your stack is clean and flat enough, it's possible to tank the Perfect Clear and still end up below the top of the board.
    But these tricks are hard to pull off and I wouldn't count on them to a beginner.

## Ignore the continuations

You might encounter many different ways to keep going after the DT Cannon: "Amemiya Cannon", "C-Spin", "Side 4-Wide"...

However, these continuations are intended for slower games that give you enough time to build them.
In TETR.IO, where speed is uncapped, you probably won't get a chance to do any of these before your opponent counterattacks.

For practical purposes, the only continuation you need to know is:

- Tuck an L piece under the overhang;
- Stack for a Tetris.
