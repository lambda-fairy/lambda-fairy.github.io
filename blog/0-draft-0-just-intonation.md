# Just intonation isn't about "purity"

There has been a lot of hubbub around microtonality and tuning systems lately.
From educators like [Adam Neely], to musicians like [Sevish] and the [STAFFcirc collective], microtonal music has been slowly but steadily approaching the mainstream.

## What is just intonation?

Just intonation has its roots in the physics of sound.

Many instruments in Western music, like the flute or violin, have a particular sound profile.
If you play a note, say at 100&nbsp;Hz, the body also resonates at whole-number multiples of this base frequency: 200&nbsp;Hz, 300&nbsp;Hz, 400&nbsp;Hz...

ðŸ™‚

When two of these instruments are played together, separated by a simple whole-number ratio (like 1:2), many of these peaks align:

ðŸ™‚

With this alignment, the ear perceives the sound not as two separate instruments, but one unified whole.
The result can be described as *smooth*, *resonant*, *beatless*, *piercing*, *locked-in*...

Just intonation is the idea that music should be tuned to whole-number ratios, to emphasize this *locked-in* effect.

## Is just intonation consonant?

If you've learned a bit of music theory, it might be tempting to call this feeling "consonance".
But this label isn't quite right:

- In contemporary Western practice, a "major third" is expressed as the cube root of two---far from the 4:5 ratio it is supposed to approximate.
  Yet the third is still considered consonant to our ears.

- The "harmonic seventh", or 4:7, has a smooth and clear sound.
  Yet in the Western classical tradition, it's considered an exotic dissonance.

These differences come up because music is a *cultural* phenomenon: the definition of "consonance" depends very much on the context in which it's used.
While just intonation is held as an ideal in the Indian classical and barbershop traditions, it is irrelevant to jazz and gamelan.

## Jazz and temperament

Jazz has its roots in the 19th century, when the 12 equal temperament system had already taken hold in the West.
As a result, the tradition was shaped by both the system's weaknesses and strengths.

For example, one of the flaws of 12-equal is the roughness of its major thirds, which can feel out of place in an otherwise resonant environment.
But if we place a fifth on top, we create a *major seventh* chord, where the inharmonicity of the third is obscured by the pure fifth.
This technique can be taken further to create "ninths", "elevenths", and "thirteenths".
Today, jazz is full of these *extended chords*, so much so that the technique is inseparable from jazz itself.

And in return for this roughness, 12-equal provides an unparalleled amount of structure.
Perhaps the most famous example would be [Giant Steps], which builds a ladder of thirds that---due to the symmetry of 12-equal---loops back to the beginning.
This kind of manipulation wouldn't be possible in just intonation.[^bbut]

[^bbut]:
    Technically, the chord progression doesn't need this symmetry to loop, as the stack of thirds that's built up in the former half is wound back down in the latter.
    But in practice no-one (besides microtonalists) plays the piece that way.

## Gamelan and inharmonicity

The gamelan tradition of southeast Asia also disregards just intonation, but for a different reason.

For an instrument to have whole-number harmonics, its sound must come from a component that's long and thin and stretchy.
On the violin, this is its strings.
On the flute, this is its column of air.

But a gamelan ensemble is defined by its metallic percussion, shaped in disks and bars.
When struck, waves spread throughout the material, interfering with themselves in elaborate ways.
The result is a metallic, shimmering sound with no whole-number harmonics in sight.

In fact, it is common to tune pairs of instruments slightly offset from each other, to develop this interference further.
A just intonation framework would not consider this consonant at all---but in gamelan, this is a key part of the style.

## The moral of the story

Just intonation is one system of many.
In the right context, it can be used to create beautiful music, and build a deeper understanding of existing works.
But it's important to understand that it isn't everything.
Beatlessness is not always the goal.
