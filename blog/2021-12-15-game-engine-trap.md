# The game engine trap

There's a bit of a meme going 'round in the gamedev community.

A beginner dev has a great idea for a game.
But instead of using a preÃ«xisting game engine, they decide to build one themselves.
Months pass.
Thousands of lines of code are written.
They still don't have a game.

This is the *[game engine trap]*.

When I started building my new website, I thought I'd create the perfect static site generator for it.
It would boast incremental and parallel builds, have a built-in preview server with hot reload, and above all---be 100% written in Rust.

It took a couple weekends before I realized my mistake.

The [final setup] is a lot less ambitious:

- The build is orchestrated via a [Makefile].
  Since Make is already incremental and parallel, I don't have to implement those features myself.
- The preview server is `python3 -m http.server`.
- I rebuild on changes with [entr].
- There is no hot reload.
  When I make a change, I tab to the browser and press F5.

[entr]: https://eradman.com/entrproject/

The only bespoke component is a small Rust binary that processes each individual page.
Even then, most of that code is copied from [another project], so it isn't that bespoke after all.

## The moral of the story

If there's any conclusion that could be had from this, it's: **know what you want!**

I realized early on that I didn't care about how the website was built.
By minimizing that part of the project, I could focus on what I really wanted to do: [fuck around with CSS ðŸ˜Ž]
