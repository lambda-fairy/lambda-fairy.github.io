# Monads in 300 words

Many contemporary languages have one or more of these features:

-   Null propagation;
-   Async/await;
-   List comprehensions.

In the 90s, programmers observed that all of these can be modeled by a single interface.
They called the interface **"monad"** after a mathematical concept that looked similar.
With this interface, they could define a single [syntax][donotation] and [utility library][controlmonad] that covers all three.

[donotation]: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/do_notation
[controlmonad]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.17.0.0/docs/Control-Monad.html#g:4

Cute!

## Why don't other languages have monads?

Good question.

-   **The language cannot express the concept.**
    The monad interface is generic _over generic types_ -- the `List` in `List<T>`.
    Most languages can't be generic like this, and the languages that can run into [further problems][boats] down the line.

-   **The language can already do it some other way.**
    For example, Scheme has [first-class continuations][callcc] that let the user override control flow in a similar way.
    Building monads on top of that would be redundant.

-   **The simplification isn't that large in practice.**
    Most code only deals with a handful of monads.
    So we can just define N syntaxes and call it a day.
    Sure, there might be some duplication here and there -- consider [`Option::flatten`][optionflatten] vs [`Result::flatten`][resultflatten] vs [`Iterator::flatten`][iteratorflatten] -- but who cares?

Haskell, a pure functional language with fancy types and a heavy runtime system, is in a perfect position to support monads.
But other languages have different goals in mind, and those goals might not align in the same way.

## Should I care about monads?

If you are learning Haskell, or a similar statically-typed functional language, then understanding monads is a necessity.
(If you're not, then I recommend it.
Functional programming is cool!)

But I don't think reading tutorials is a good idea.[^hypocrisy]
"Monad" is but a small part of Haskell as a whole.
Studying it in isolation, and expecting to understand anything, makes as much sense as learning Python through its [descriptor system][descriptor].

[^hypocrisy]: No, this article doesn't count ðŸ™‚

Instead, *write code*.

Play with async I/O.

Implement some type classes.

And at some point it'll all make sense.
