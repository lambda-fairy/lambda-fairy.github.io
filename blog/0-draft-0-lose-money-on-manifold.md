# How to lose money on Manifold

[Manifold] is a play-money prediction betting site.
Users can post a question about a future event, like ["Will Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerburg fight in 2023?"][fight], and other users can bet on whether it'll happen or not.

And like any betting site, it's really easy to lose all your (fake) money.

In this article, I'll outline three easy ways to lose on Manifold---and how to avoid them.

## Over-extending

As you browse the site, you'll see a few questions that have settled at a low or high value---maybe 10% or 90%.
It might be tempting to bet NO on 10% or YES on 90%.
After all, if they're a "sure bet", then it's easy money, right?

But if you play with the bet slider, you'll notice that bets get much more expensive as they approach the extremes.
It might take only 10 mana (Manifold's currency) to move from 50% to 60%, but 100 mana to move from 90% to 91%.
All for barely any profit.

!["Yes" bet screen at 99%. It takes 100 mana investment for a potential 1 mana profit.](/images/2023/lose-money-on-manifold/99.png)

This is because, fundamentally, profit doesn't come from doing the same thing as everyone else.
**Profit comes from knowing *more* than the market**.
If everyone already thinks that Hillary Clinton will win, you won't gain much from agreeing with them.
On the other hand, you have a lot to lose if that turns out wrong!

So before you empty your wallet to move a market from 98% to 99%, ask yourself: *Do I really think that event has a 99% chance of happening?*
*Or am I just buying into the hype?*

## Counterparty risk

One unique feature of Manifold is that *anyone* can create a prediction market.

This allows for a wide range of niche topics, like [whether AI can win a mathematics competition][imo].
Or [Jennifer Lopez's eating habits][lopez].

But it also means that **the creator decides how the question resolves**.
While admins do intervene in egregious cases, a lot of the time the creator's word will stand---whether you agree with it or not.

To avoid disappointment, be sure to read the description carefully, and ask clarifying questions if you need to.

Manifold also has a creator reputation system, but it's a bit hard to find.
If you open up a user's profile, you'll see a "Reviews" button that shows how other traders have rated them.
(If it's not there, it means they haven't resolved any questions yet.)
Be sure to check their reviews before betting!

## Whale-bait

There are a lot of questions like these:

- [Will this market close above 50%?][bait0]
- [Will this market resolve above 50%?][bait1]
- [Will this question close above 50%?][bait2]

[bait0]: https://manifold.markets/pa/will-this-market-close-above-50-per?r=dGZhZQ
[bait1]: https://manifold.markets/LightLawliet/will-this-market-resolve-above-50?r=dGZhZQ
[bait2]: https://manifold.markets/Estarducs/will-this-question-close-above-50?r=dGZhZQ

The problem with these questions is that **they're decided by whoever has the most money**.
Someone with 100k mana can go all-in, seconds before market close, and guarantee their win.

Unless you're the one dumping 100k, avoid these markets!

## The moral of the story

Good trading is about making reasonable moves.
It's about steering clear of the hype, and understanding what you buy.

If you stay calm and humble, you too can execute good trades.
And you might earn back all the money you lost ðŸ™‚
