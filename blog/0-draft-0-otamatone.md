# Otamatone: A Musician's Guide

The *otamatone* (portmanteau of *[otamajakushi]* and *tone*) is a fretless synthesizer.
Though marketed as a toy, its larger models have potential as musical instruments.
Some YouTubers, such as [mklachu] and [TheRealSullyG], are popular for their otamatone covers.

There are resources scattered around the web on how to obtain and play the otamatone.
With this guide, I hope to collect this information in a single, easy-to-read place.

## Which model should I buy?

There are many models of the Otamatone, but the main ones are:

- The **Original** (27&nbsp;cm) otamatone is pretty affordable, and can produce a good sound if you're careful.
  But its small size can make it difficult to play for beginners.

- The **Deluxe** (44&nbsp;cm) size is the largest mass-produced model.[^large]
  It has a 3.5&nbsp;mm jack and an AC inlet (adapter not included).
  This is the easiest to play, but can be expensive.

[^large]: Some [promotional materials] show guitar-sized---or larger---models, but there's no easy way to obtain those.

These have corresponding updated versions, with smartphone connectivity:

- The **Neo** is an updated, slightly larger Original.

- The **Techno** is an updated Deluxe.

Overall, I recommend the Deluxe; it's what I play myself.
I don't think the extra features of the Techno are worth it, but I'd take it if it's on sale.

The remaining models are novelties:

- The **Melody** plays pre-recorded songs.

- The **Digital** is a keytar.

## Components

### Ribbon

Triggers a sound when pressed.

The ribbon makes the otamatone *fretless*: rather than being fixed to the 12 notes of mainstream Western music, it's a continuous strip where every pitch is available.
This allows for cool effects like vibrato, pitch bends, and [microtonality].
But it can take a bit of practice to use well.

Moreover, like a string instrument, the pitches get closer together as you go down the neck:

It's a little detail that I appreciate.

### Octave switch

Switches between low, medium, and high notes.
I've found little use in low and high, but in theory it could be useful for ensembles.

### The mouth

The otamatone's speaker is tucked inside of a silicone mouth, which obscures and shapes the sound.
You can influence this shaping by squeezing its sides.

When the mouth is closed, the sound is a bit quieter, and sounds like "mmm".
When open, the sound is a bit louder, and sounds like "aaa".

## Technique

### Left or right hand?

I've seen people play the otamatone with either hand.
If you already know the guitar, violin, or similar, then having your non-dominant hand on the neck might feel most familiar.
Feel free to experiment and see what works for you.

### Touch sensitivity

Unlike a phone's touch screen, the otamatone's ribbon switch needs a bit of squish to activate.
For a clean glissando, make sure you maintain a consistent pressure throughout.

### Vibrato

This is when you vary the pitch by shaking your hand up and down.
The effect gives the sound warmth, and can give a professional quality to your otamatone playing.

The technique is kind of hard to explain over text, but I've heard it described as "turning a doorknob, but smaller, and faster".

Yeah.

### Intonation

Getting it to sound "in tune" might be the hardest part of learning the otamatone.
Even with my violin experience, it took a few weeks of fiddling to get something recognizable.
That said, there are a few tips that can help in the meantime.

Keep your fingers equally spaced.
This will help build muscle memory.

Don't be afraid to scoop---sliding until you hit the right note---to your advantage.

A trick from beginner string players: put stickers on the side of the otamatone, showing where each finger should go.
You can use a tuning app to figure out the positions.
If you're hesitant to tarnish your precious instrument, the back screws can act as a guide too.

Vibrato can come in handy as well.
Since it widens the perceived pitch, it can hide flaws in the intonation.

If you're new to fretless instruments, or music production in general, it might help to develop your ability to recognize good tuning.
There are many such "ear training" resources online, including apps; a search should yield plenty.
This will help you as a musician overall, not just an otamatone player.

## Potential issues

### Battery life

The otamatone is battery powered device, so there's always the risk that the battery runs out mid-performance.

In my experience, the included batteries have survived occasional use for a few months.
But for long-term playing, I'd recommend getting some high-quality lithium batteries.
This is where the Deluxe is useful---you can power it through an AC adapter instead.

### Different tunings

The instruments aren't well calibrated.
The lowest note might be closer to F, Fâ™¯, or G, depending on which otamatone you use.
This can even vary across octave settings!

Fortunately, the tuning for a particular otamatone doesn't drift over time (in my experience at least).
So this is only an issue if you switch instruments.

### Breaking

If you're rough with the otamatone, it might break at the base of the neck.
Nothing a bit of tape can't fix, but be careful!
