<p>The <em>otamatone</em> (portmanteau of <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%8A%E7%8E%89%E6%9D%93%E5%AD%90">otamajakushi</a></em> and <em>tone</em>) is a fretless synthesizer.
Though marketed as a toy, its larger models have potential as musical instruments.
Some YouTubers, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/mklachu">mklachu</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheRealSullyG">TheRealSullyG</a>, are popular for their otamatone covers.</p>
<p>There are resources scattered around the web on how to obtain and play the otamatone.
With this guide, I hope to collect this information in a single, easy-to-read place.</p>
<h2><a href="#which-model-should-i-buy" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="which-model-should-i-buy"></a>Which model should I buy?</h2>
<p>There are many models of the Otamatone, but the main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Original</strong> (27 cm) otamatone is pretty affordable, and can produce a good sound if you’re careful.
But its small size can make it difficult to play for beginners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Deluxe</strong> (44 cm) size is the largest mass-produced model.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-large" id="fnref-large" data-footnote-ref>1</a></sup>
It has a 3.5 mm jack and an AC inlet (adapter not included).
This is the easiest to play, but can be expensive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These have corresponding updated versions, with smartphone connectivity:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Neo</strong> is an updated, slightly larger Original.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Techno</strong> is an updated Deluxe.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I recommend the Deluxe; it’s what I play myself.
I don’t think the extra features of the Techno are worth it, but I’d take it if it’s on sale.</p>
<p>The remaining models are novelties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Melody</strong> plays pre-recorded songs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Digital</strong> is a keytar.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#components" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="components"></a>Components</h2>
<h3><a href="#ribbon" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="ribbon"></a>Ribbon</h3>
<a class="image-box" href="/images/2022/otamatone/ribbon.jpg"><img src="/images/2022/otamatone/ribbon.jpg" alt="The long, touch-sensitive neck of an otamatone.
" title=""></a>
<p>Triggers a sound when pressed.</p>
<p>The ribbon makes the otamatone <em>fretless</em>: rather than being fixed to the 12 notes of mainstream Western music, it’s a continuous strip where every pitch is available.
This allows for cool effects like vibrato, pitch bends, and <a href="https://youtu.be/fBeP3Nhtpxg">microtonality</a>.
But it can take a bit of practice to use well.</p>
<p>Moreover, like a string instrument, the pitches get closer together as you go down the neck:</p>
<p>TODO image</p>
<p>It’s a little detail that I appreciate.</p>
<h3><a href="#octave-switch" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="octave-switch"></a>Octave switch</h3>
<a class="image-box" href="/images/2022/otamatone/octave-switch.jpg"><img src="/images/2022/otamatone/octave-switch.jpg" alt="The back side of an otamatone, with a low-mid-high slider switch highlighted.
" title=""></a>
<p>Switches between low, medium, and high notes.
I’ve found little use in low and high, but in theory it could be useful for ensembles.</p>
<h3><a href="#the-mouth" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-mouth"></a>The mouth</h3>
<p>The otamatone’s speaker is tucked inside of a silicone mouth, which obscures and shapes the sound.
You can influence this shaping by squeezing its sides.</p>
<p>When the mouth is closed, the sound is a bit quieter, and sounds like “mmm”.
When open, the sound is a bit louder, and sounds like “aaa”.</p>
<h2><a href="#technique" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="technique"></a>Technique</h2>
<h3><a href="#left-or-right-hand" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="left-or-right-hand"></a>Left or right hand?</h3>
<p>I’ve seen people play the otamatone with either hand.
If you already know the guitar, violin, or similar, then having your non-dominant hand on the neck might feel most familiar.
Feel free to experiment and see what works for you.</p>
<h3><a href="#touch-sensitivity" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="touch-sensitivity"></a>Touch sensitivity</h3>
<p>Unlike a phone’s touch screen, the otamatone’s ribbon switch needs a bit of squish to activate.
For a clean glissando, make sure you maintain a consistent pressure throughout.</p>
<h3><a href="#vibrato" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="vibrato"></a>Vibrato</h3>
<p>This is when you vary the pitch by shaking your hand up and down.
The effect gives the sound warmth, and can give a professional quality to your otamatone playing.</p>
<p>The technique is kind of hard to explain over text, but I’ve heard it described as “turning a doorknob, but smaller, and faster”.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<h3><a href="#intonation" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="intonation"></a>Intonation</h3>
<p>Getting it to sound “in tune” might be the hardest part of learning the otamatone.
Even with my violin experience, it took a few weeks of fiddling to get something recognizable.
That said, there are a few tips that can help in the meantime.</p>
<p>Keep your fingers equally spaced.
This will help build muscle memory.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to scoop—sliding until you hit the right note—to your advantage.</p>
<p>A trick from beginner string players: put stickers on the side of the otamatone, showing where each finger should go.
You can use a tuning app to figure out the positions.
If you’re hesitant to tarnish your precious instrument, the back screws can act as a guide too.</p>
<p>Vibrato can come in handy as well.
Since it widens the perceived pitch, it can hide flaws in the intonation.</p>
<p>If you’re new to fretless instruments, or music production in general, it might help to develop your ability to recognize good tuning.
There are many such “ear training” resources online, including apps; a search should yield plenty.
This will help you as a musician overall, not just an otamatone player.</p>
<h2><a href="#potential-issues" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="potential-issues"></a>Potential issues</h2>
<h3><a href="#battery-life" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="battery-life"></a>Battery life</h3>
<p>The otamatone is battery powered device, so there’s always the risk that the battery runs out mid-performance.</p>
<p>In my experience, the included batteries have survived occasional use for a few months.
But for long-term playing, I’d recommend getting some high-quality lithium batteries.
This is where the Deluxe is useful—you can power it through an AC adapter instead.</p>
<h3><a href="#different-tunings" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="different-tunings"></a>Different tunings</h3>
<p>The instruments aren’t well calibrated.
The lowest note might be closer to F, F♯, or G, depending on which otamatone you use.
This can even vary across octave settings!</p>
<p>Fortunately, the tuning for a particular otamatone doesn’t drift over time (in my experience at least).
So this is only an issue if you switch instruments.</p>
<h3><a href="#breaking" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="breaking"></a>Breaking</h3>
<p>If you’re rough with the otamatone, it might break at the base of the neck.
Nothing a bit of tape can’t fix, but be careful!</p>
